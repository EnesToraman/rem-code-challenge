# Skip Hire App Redesign â€” Coding Challenge

---

## ðŸŽ¯ About the Challenge

This project is part of a coding challenge where I was asked to **redesign and improve the existing Skip Hire App screens**, focusing on:

- AI-first approach
- More modern and compact UX
- Improved code structure and scalability
- Good responsiveness
- Clean UI/UX enhancements

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **React Query**

---

## âœ¨ My Approach

Here is an overview of the improvements and decisions I made during this challenge:

- âœ… **AI-Ready / Scalable Architecture**  
  Built with an eye toward easily integrating AI-based features in future iterations.

- âœ… **Compact & Modern Product Listing**  
  Redesigned the product list with a more compact and visually modern style.

- âœ… **Type-Safe Codebase**  
  Utilized `interface`-based structures to ensure type safety and robust data handling.

- âœ… **Dark / Light Mode Support**  
  Implemented a dark/light theme toggle with localStorage persistence.

- âœ… **Optimized Data Fetching with React Query**  
  Moved data fetching into a custom React hook using React Query â€” a scalable pattern for future growth.

- âœ… **Reusable Components**  
  Built reusable and composable UI components for better maintainability.

- âœ… **Skeleton Loaders for UX**  
  Added skeleton loading components to improve perceived performance and loading UX.

- âœ… **Alias-Based Imports**  
  Set up path aliases to improve code readability and reduce import complexity.

- âœ… **Responsive & Robust Layout**  
  Ensured a fully responsive UI, with careful attention to overflow handling and avoiding content overlap across devices.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open the app in your browser:  
    [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## ðŸš§ Notes

- This is a simplified challenge version â€” certain features (e.g. full backend integration, AI-driven features) are left as future work.
- The codebase is structured to easily scale and adapt to more advanced use cases.
